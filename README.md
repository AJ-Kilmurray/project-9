# Overview
Temperature converter made using HTML, JS & Bootstrap.

## Description
Basic javascript project to re-assure my knowledge and progression with the language. Built this within a few hours and got to experiment with bootstrap for the first time.

### What I learned about Bootstrap
I used Bootstrap for the first time, and is my first CSS framework. 
* Very simple, yet effective technology. Went in with 0 prior practice or research and was surprised at how great the documentation was.
* Understanding of CSS frameworks. (How/Why they are used)
* How to implement CSS frameworks into a project.
* Super simple responsive design.

### Things to be improved
I'll be learning much more about bootstrap within the coming weeks, and how to master the basics. Using bootstrap will help tremendously with the speed of implementation and development on my journey towards becoming a full-stack web developer.
